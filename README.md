# Custom Environment Builder

The purpose of the Custom Environment Builder is to allow users to build virtual environments/scenes for the [MRCane](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3565970.3568189) application. While not a part of the MRCane application, this is an addition to the application. Currently, MRCane has a fixed environment made by developers. This places a great limitation on the blind users using MRCane as they would only be able to explore one environment. The Custom Environment Builder will help increase the amount of environments the users can explore.

The Custom Environment Builder enables the user to create environments composed of objects based on the object selection hotbar. Furthermore, the user will be able to save current progress and load the environments they have made.

This application was developed using Unity 3D and C#.
